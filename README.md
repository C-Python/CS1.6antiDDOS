# CS1.6antiDDOS
# There is a lot of methods to Dos/Ddos a cs 1.6 server, VSE/ACK/(+And a lot more_).

# If it's just VSE/ACK you can hook Sv_ConnectionlessPacket + hook "net_from" ( You can find an example coded by Arkshine using okapi ) and then limit the packets sent per second ( Based on IP's ).

# Ps. : I did manage to do a A2S_ACK flood just using a plugin + sockets and it did crash the server.
# So i'm just giving you an example. SV_ConnectionlessPacket you can search for it on the Internet.
# Good luck.
